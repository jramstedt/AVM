Audio/Video Management
======================

INSTALLATION:
  1. Untar AVM (or copy) to desired directory. For example /opt (files will be in /opt/AVM)
  2. Setup http server configuration
	Lighttpd:
		alias.url += ( "/AVM" => "/opt/AVM" )
		url.rewrite += ( "^/AVM.*[/](.*(css))" => "/AVM/$1",
                 		 "^/AVM.*[/](.*(jpg|png|gif))" => "/AVM/image/$1",
                 		 "^/AVM.*[/](.*(js))" => "/AVM/js/$1",
                 		 "^/AVM/(.*)$" => "/AVM/index.php?$1")
	Apache:
		---
  3. Create MySQL database. 
  4. Import database.sql
  5. Set privileges to database:
	SELECT, INSERT
	CREATE, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, CREATE VIEW, EVENT, TRIGGER, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, EXECUTE
	Disable everything else (e.g. UPDATE).
  6. Set table specific priveleges:
	feed table (and specific columns):
		UPDATE data
		DELETE
	usersetting table (and specific columns):
		UPDATE filter timelimit
  7. Edit config.php
  8. Check that avmutility.php has correct interpreter directive for your system (e.g. #!/usr/bin/php)
  9. Add feed updater cronjob:
	0 * * * * cd /opt/AVM && /opt/AVM/avmutility.php --updatefeeds >/dev/null 2>&1
 10. Only read rights are needed for most files.
     avmutility.php should also have execute right.
     !IMPORTANT! config.php should only have read rights for www-user!
